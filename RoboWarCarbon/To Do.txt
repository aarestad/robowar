Feel free to add items and comments!

1. Add User Interfaces for the robot stations.
	I suggest we have a seperate window for each robot, and
	use an HIToolbar to switch between the stations (as well as the menus).
	The window for this will need to be built in a seperate .nib file.

2. Tournament engine.
	Windows for this should be defined in tournament.nib.

3. Add support for RWXML files.
	RWXML should eventually be the default format, however, the app should
	still be able to read and write old-style bot files.

4. Application, Document and Toolbar icons.

5. Stored Preferences... use CFPreferences. -- Silly me, this was already done. - SR

6. Make engine support multiple arenas (move away from global variables).
	This will be especially useful for Tournaments run on multi-processor machines as seperate
	battles could be run in seperate threads... sharing the load between processors.
	Of course, we'd need mutex locks on the roster records... but that shouldn't be hard to add.
	This will also entail actually spawning threads for each battle...
