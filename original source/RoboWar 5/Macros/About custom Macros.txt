A macro is a code scrap that you'll use frequently.
You can have 6 custom macros which will be accesible 
though this menu. Here's how to add a macro:

1. Create a text document containing the macro and give
the text document an appropriate name. 

2. Place the document in the folder called "Macros" in 
the game's folder.

You can now insert the code scrap just by clicking the 
menu or using the F keys.
